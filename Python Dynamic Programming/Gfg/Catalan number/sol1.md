#### Sol1 
- Dynamic Programming - Top Down Approach using Recursion + memoization
- the formula is of summation from i=0 to i=n-1


#### Sol2
- Dynamic Programming - Bottom Up Approach using iteration + tabulation
- the logic remains same i.e the formula (the summation)
- we just add ups catalan numbers using for loop
